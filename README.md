# Mechanical Crafting Recipe GUI

## Create recipe code with a visual aid

- Each unqiue symbol for input items will be assigned a color for improved clarity
- (WIP) Multiple outputs with drop chance percentage
- Create any sized crafting grid you wish (vertical grids have sizing problems but still work as intended)

### To launch. Download .html file and simply open it. 
- Does make a google api call to load Jquery, so does require internet but that file can be added if needed offline.
